# 📊 XLOOKUP Dashboard in Excel  

This project is an **interactive dashboard in Excel** that leverages **XLOOKUP** to dynamically retrieve and analyze data.  

## 🔍 What is XLOOKUP?  
**XLOOKUP** is a powerful Excel function that replaces **VLOOKUP**, **HLOOKUP**, and **INDEX/MATCH**. It allows for more flexible and efficient data retrieval by:  
- Searching **vertically or horizontally** in a table.  
- Returning **exact or approximate matches** without requiring sorted data.  
- Looking **from left to right or right to left**, unlike VLOOKUP.  
- Supporting **multiple criteria** and error handling.  

## 📌 Features of This Dashboard  
- **Dynamic data lookup** using **XLOOKUP**.  
- **Interactive filtering** for better data visualization.  
- **Automatic updates** when the source data changes.  
- **Well-organized layout** to make analysis easier.

2. **Navigate through the dashboard** and test the XLOOKUP functionality.  
3. **Modify the input values** to see real-time data retrieval.  
4. **Explore and customize** according to your needs!
